Open Energy Data Hack Days project.

# Design Challenge
How might we visualize peaks, valleys and provenance of electric power,
so that end consumers know when consumption and production is most ecological and/or cheapest.

# Business Goals
Minimize the necessity to buy expensive, "dirty" electricity (produced from oil and coal).

- reduce peaks (peak shaving)
- reduce unplanned differences in consumption and production
